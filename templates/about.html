				<p>Across MENA, new markets and new consumers are demanding new insights. This Prize will act as a spur to strategic thinkers across the region by generating a collection of work that will inspire them to create breakthrough thinking for their clients.</p>
				<p>We also need to know that the strategy 'worked'. Although this is not an effectiveness competition, we want to reward strategic thinking that helps clients solve problems and provides a base for future growth. Entrants will be expected to show a link between their strategies and the results of the marketing activity.</p>
				<p>The Prize is free to enter and is open to clients and agencies in any marketing discipline.</p>
